`Open Knowledge Protocol For` is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed for coordination of digital assets such as datasets, algorithms, software, storage or computation. Anyone can build and join custom Zones where rules are shared and value flows between participants. OKP4 enables to build a new generation of dApps way beyond Decentralized Finance.

## ðŸ”— The protocol

`OKP4` is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) ðŸ’« & [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus, and allows companies & individuals to define on-chain rules, share any off-chain resources & create a new generation of applications on top of them. With OKP4, share anything digital, on your own terms
ðŸš€ solves the trust issue related to digital resources sharing
ðŸš€ sovereign, scalable, multichain & fully customizable (built on Cosmos, leveraging IBC, ICQ & ICA)
ðŸš€ unlocking real-world value creation, bridging the gap between web2 & web3.

After 3+ years of strategy, research and development, OKP4 is almost ready to become the foundation for a scalable Open Dataverse, unlocking a new wave of use cases through real-world decentralized coordination. Our team & community is building a set of tools at the infrastructure, protocol, data and application layers with UX, interoperability, privacy and security in mind, ready to ignite innovation through data sharing.
