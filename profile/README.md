`Open Knowledge Protocol For` is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed to enable communities to trustlessly share data, algorithms and resources to build the Dataverse - An open world where everybody can create or participate in custom ecosystems (with common governance mechanisms, sharing rules, business models...) to build a new generation of dApps way beyond Decentralized Finance.

### The protocol

`OKP4` is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) & [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus, and is designed to become a hub of data providers, developer communities, data scientists and users to optimize and maximize value creation.

After 3 years of development, OKP4's team is now composed of 20+ full-time people on track to enable scalable real-world decentralized coordination. Through powerful incentive mechanisms and innovative design, we enable anyone to contribute and be rewarded confidently.
