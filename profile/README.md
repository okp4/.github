`Open Knowledge Protocol For` is a public [dPoS](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS) layer 1 specifically designed to enable communities to trustlessly share data, algorithms and resources to build the Dataverse - An open world where everybody can create or participate in custom ecosystems (with common governance mechanisms, sharing rules, business models...) to build a new generation of dApps way beyond Decentralized Finance.

## ðŸ”— The protocol

`OKP4` is built on the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk) ðŸ’« & [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) consensus, and is designed to become a hub of incentivized data providers, developers, data scientists & users collaborating to generate value from data and algorithms.

After 3+ years of strategy, research and development, OKP4 is almost ready to become the foundation for a scalable Open Dataverse, unlocking a new wave of use cases through real-world decentralized coordination. Our team & community is building a set of tools at the infrastructure, protocol, data and application layers with UX, interoperability, privacy and security in mind, ready to ignite innovation through data sharing.
